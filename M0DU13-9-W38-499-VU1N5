>>>THEORY<<<
9.a- What is an XSS?, how many types of XSS are there and how do they work? How is this vulnerability mitigated?
Once you have learned the theory of how they work, search for examples and generate them in one of the sites listed at http://www.vulnweb.com/ (site with pages for basic practices) - send a screenshot DO NOT GENERATE IT IN ANY OTHER SITE OTHER THAN FROM THE VULNWEB LIST,
9.b- What is an SQLi? how does it work? What tools are there to do it? How are they mitigated? Once the investigation is done, choose one of the sites from http://www.vulnweb.com/ and run an sqli - send a screenshot

9.d - investigate what is a ddos attack? What tools are there to do it? How are they mitigated?
