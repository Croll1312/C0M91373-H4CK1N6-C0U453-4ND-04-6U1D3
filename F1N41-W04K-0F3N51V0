Practical VM (virtual machines):

-Download the iso from BadStore, and install it on a vm (if necessary look for a tutorial and do it) https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/badstore-123,41/

Basic steps of a pentest to keep in mind to follow:

II.Test connection by ping.

II.Scanning ports and services with the help of Nmap.

III. Perform a directory search with one of these tools (investigate each one of them, install and use the one that seems best to you):
*dirbuster
*dirsearch
*gobuster
*feroxbuster

Investigate badly obfuscated (exposed) files and directories.
Exploit the vulnerabilities seen in this practical work (xss, sqli, authentication bypass, sensitive information, etc.)
Use hping3 or slowhttptest to ddos badstore (YOUR VM and send a screenshot of the result)
